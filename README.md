# Schemas-LLMInstruction
Schema LLM Instructions is a Schema.org extension that allows for providing instructions and technical parameters to large language models (LLMs). It aims to improve communication between humans and LLMs by enabling users to specify precise tasks, constraints, and preferences for text generation.


**Schema LLM Instructions** is a autonomous Schema.org extension that allows for providing instructions and technical parameters to large language models (LLMs). It aims to improve communication between humans and LLMs by enabling users to specify precise tasks, constraints, and preferences for text generation.

**Main features:**

* **Instructions:** Allows for providing instructions in natural language or in a structured format to guide the language model.
* **Technical parameters:** Offers a set of properties to control the technical parameters of the model, such as temperature, top-k sampling, repetition penalty, etc.
* **TechnicalParameter subclass:** Organizes the technical parameters under a single class for better structure and readability.
* **Author, version, and date:** Includes properties to specify the author, version, and creation date of the extension.

**Objectives:**

* Improve the accuracy and relevance of LLM responses.
* Encourage creativity and the exploration of original ideas.
* Facilitate the adaptation of LLMs to specific tasks and contexts.
* Promote more intuitive and effective communication between humans and LLMs.

**Target audience:**

* Developers of language models.
* Users of language models.
* Artificial intelligence researchers.
* Anyone wishing to interact with LLMs in a more precise and controlled manner.

**Status:**

Personal extension of Schema.org, potentially evolving into a broader extension or a proposal for an official extension.

**Remarks:**

* The extension is still under development and may be subject to change.
* Full documentation of the extension is in progress.
* Users are encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions to improve the extension.
